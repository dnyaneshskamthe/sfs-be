# Node.js Backend

Welcome to the Node.js backend for our web application. This backend server provides the necessary API endpoints to support our web app.

## Getting Started

Follow these steps to get the backend server up and running:

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, make sure you have the following installed:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (version 14 or higher)
- [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) (usually comes with Node.js)

### Installation

1. Clone this repository:

   ```bash
   https://github.com/dnyaneshskamthe/sfs-be.git
   cd your-node-backend
   ```

2. Install the required dependencies:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

### Starting the Server

To start the backend server, use the following command:

```bash
node App.js
```

The server will start on `http://localhost:5000`.

## Running the Frontend

The frontend of this application is a separate Vite app, which you've already copied to the `public` folder. To run the frontend, follow these steps:

1. Make sure you have Node.js and npm installed (as mentioned in the prerequisites).

2. Navigate to the root directory of your frontend project (the Vite app).

3. Install the frontend dependencies:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

4. Build and run the frontend:

   ```bash
   npm run build
   npm run serve
   ```

The frontend development server will start on `http://localhost:3000`.

Now, you can access your web application by opening your browser and navigating to `http://localhost:3000`. The frontend and backend will work together to provide the complete web experience.

Feel free to customize and enhance this backend as needed for your project!
